                    OPENBROADCASTER - PLAYBACK & DECKS
================================================================================

OpenBroadcaster features two main playback decks (Deck A and Deck B) that allow
for professional radio-style mixing and seamless transitions between tracks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECK OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each deck displays:

+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  DECK A                                              [Now Playing] |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                    |

|                                                                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

WAVEFORM DISPLAY:
- Shows the audio waveform of the loaded track
- Playhead (vertical line) shows current position
- Click anywhere on the waveform to seek to that position
- Darker regions indicate quieter parts, brighter = louder

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRANSPORT CONTROLS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each deck has standard transport controls:

  [|<]  PREVIOUS    - Jump to beginning of track (or previous in queue)
  [<<]  REWIND      - Seek backward (hold for continuous)
  [PLAY/PAUSE]      - Toggle playback
  [>>]  FAST FWD    - Seek forward (hold for continuous)
  [>|]  NEXT        - Skip to next track in queue

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
  Spacebar          - Play/Pause Deck A
  Shift+Spacebar    - Play/Pause Deck B
  Left Arrow        - Seek back 5 seconds (focused deck)
  Right Arrow       - Seek forward 5 seconds (focused deck)
  Home              - Jump to beginning of track
  End               - Jump to end of track (useful for previewing outros)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOADING TRACKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several ways to load a track onto a deck:

1. DOUBLE-CLICK
   - Double-click any track in the library to load it to the next available deck

2. DRAG AND DROP
   - Drag a track from the library and drop it on a specific deck

3. FROM QUEUE
   - When a track finishes, the next queued track auto-loads (if Auto Advance on)
   - Right-click a queue item and select "Load to Deck A/B"

4. RIGHT-CLICK MENU
   - Right-click a track in the library
   - Select "Load to Deck A" or "Load to Deck B"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME CONTROL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each deck has its own volume slider:

DECK VOLUME:
- Adjusts the output level of that specific deck
- 0% = silent, 100% = full volume
- Does not affect the master output

MASTER VOLUME:
- Located in the toolbar area
- Controls the overall output level
- Affects all audio (both decks and cart wall)

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:
- Keep deck volumes at 100% for consistent levels
- Use master volume for overall adjustments
- Watch for clipping (red indicators) and reduce if needed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CUE POINTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cue points let you mark and jump to specific positions in a track:

SETTING A CUE POINT:
1. Seek to the desired position
2. Press Ctrl+1 through Ctrl+5 to set cue points 1-5
   Or right-click the waveform and select "Set Cue Point"

JUMPING TO A CUE POINT:
- Press 1-5 to jump to the corresponding cue point
- Or click the cue point markers on the waveform

USES FOR CUE POINTS:
- Mark the vocal start (skip long intros)
- Mark the outro start for smooth transitions
- Mark key moments in longer tracks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CROSSFADING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenBroadcaster supports automatic crossfading between decks:

ENABLING CROSSFADE:
1. Go to Settings > Audio
2. Enable "Auto Crossfade"
3. Set the crossfade duration (default: 3 seconds)

HOW IT WORKS:
- When a track approaches its end, the next track begins playing
- The outgoing track fades out while the incoming track fades in
- Creates smooth, professional transitions

MANUAL CROSSFADE:
- Use the crossfader slider (if visible) to manually blend between decks
- Left = Deck A only, Right = Deck B only, Center = both

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRO/OUTRO DETECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenBroadcaster can detect intro and outro points automatically:

AUTOMATIC DETECTION:
- When a track is loaded, intro/outro points are calculated
- Based on audio analysis (silence detection, level changes)

MANUAL ADJUSTMENT:
1. Right-click a track and select "Edit Intro/Outro"
2. Set the intro end time (where vocals typically start)
3. Set the outro start time (where the song winds down)

USING INTRO/OUTRO:
- AutoDJ uses these points for better mixing
- Display shows "Intro: 0:15" countdown during intros
- Helps DJs know when to talk over intros

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECK STATUS INDICATORS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Visual indicators show the deck state:

  [PLAYING]     - Green, track is playing
  [PAUSED]      - Yellow, track is paused
  [STOPPED]     - Gray, no track loaded or stopped
  [CUEING]      - Blue, track is cued and ready

TIME DISPLAY:
- Elapsed time / Total duration
- Click to toggle between elapsed and remaining time

PROGRESS BAR:
- Shows playback progress
- Color may change near the end to warn of upcoming finish

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TIPS FOR SMOOTH PLAYBACK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING QUEUED
   - Keep at least 2-3 tracks in the queue
   - Enable AutoDJ to automatically refill

2. WATCH YOUR LEVELS
   - Keep an eye on the VU meters
   - Avoid clipping (going into the red)

3. USE BOTH DECKS FOR MIXING
   - Load the next track to the idle deck
   - Preview and cue before the current track ends
   - Use crossfade for professional transitions

4. PREPARE YOUR TRANSITIONS
   - Know your intro/outro points
   - Use cue points for consistent mix points
   - Practice timing with the countdown display
