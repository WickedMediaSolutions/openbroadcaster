AUDIO CRACKLING/STUTTERING
--------------------------
1. Increase buffer size

4. Disable audio enhancements
   - Control Panel > Sound > Playback
   - Properties > Enhancements > Disable all

5. Check disk speed
   - Slow HDDs may cause stuttering
   - Consider SSD for audio files

TRACKS WON'T PLAY
-----------------
1. Check file format
   - Supported: MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A
   - Unsupported formats won't play

2. Verify file isn't corrupted
   - Try playing in another application
   - Re-download or re-rip if necessary

3. Check file path
   - File may have been moved/deleted
   - Rescan library to update paths

4. Check file permissions
   - Ensure OpenBroadcaster can read the file
   - Run as administrator if needed

================================================================================
LIBRARY ISSUES
================================================================================

LIBRARY SCAN STUCK/SLOW
-----------------------
1. Large libraries take time
   - 10,000 tracks: 1-5 minutes
   - 100,000 tracks: 10-30 minutes

2. Network drives are slower
   - Local drives scan faster
   - Consider copying files locally

3. Antivirus may interfere
   - Add OpenBroadcaster to exclusions
   - Add library folders to exclusions

TRACKS NOT APPEARING
--------------------
1. Check file format is supported
   - MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A, AAC, WMA

2. Verify folder is added
   - Settings > Library > Watch Folders
   - Add folder if missing

3. Rescan the library
   - Right-click library > Rescan Library

4. Check for hidden files
   - Some files may be hidden by Windows

WRONG METADATA SHOWING
----------------------
1. Metadata comes from file tags
   - Use MP3Tag or similar to edit tags
   - Re-scan library after editing

2. Missing tags use filename
   - Filename should be: Artist - Title.mp3
   - Or edit tags properly

================================================================================
AUTODJ ISSUES
================================================================================

AUTODJ NOT ADDING TRACKS
------------------------
1. Check AutoDJ is enabled
   - Click AutoDJ button in toolbar
   - Should be highlighted when active

2. Verify queue depth setting
   - Settings > AutoDJ > Target Queue Depth
   - AutoDJ adds when queue is below this

3. Check rotation has slots
   - Settings > AutoDJ > Rotations
   - Rotation needs defined slots

4. Verify categories have tracks
   - Categories in rotation must have assigned tracks
   - Check library category assignments

5. Review separation rules
   - Rules too strict = no valid tracks
   - Temporarily disable to test

AUTODJ PLAYING WRONG MUSIC
--------------------------
1. Check active rotation
   - Verify correct rotation is scheduled

2. Review schedule configuration
   - Settings > AutoDJ > Schedule
   - Check times and days

3. Check system clock
   - Wrong time = wrong rotation
   - Sync with internet time

SAME SONGS PLAYING TOO OFTEN
----------------------------
1. Increase separation times
   - Artist separation: 60+ minutes
   - Title separation: 180+ minutes

2. Add more tracks to categories
   - Small categories = repetition
   - Aim for 50+ tracks per category

3. Use more diverse rotations
   - Add variety to rotation slots
   - Mix different categories

================================================================================
STREAMING ISSUES
================================================================================

CAN'T CONNECT TO SERVER
-----------------------
1. Verify server address and port
   - Double-check for typos
   - Test: telnet server.com 8000

2. Check password
   - Passwords are case-sensitive
   - Copy/paste to avoid errors

3. Check mount point (Icecast)
   - Should start with /
   - Example: /live or /stream

4. Verify server is running
   - Contact hosting provider
   - Check server status page

5. Check firewall
   - Allow outbound connections
   - Port typically 8000

STREAM DROPS FREQUENTLY
-----------------------
1. Check internet stability
   - Run speed test
   - Look for packet loss

2. Reduce bitrate
   - Lower bitrate = less bandwidth needed
   - Try 128kbps instead of 256kbps

3. Check server capacity
   - Server may be overloaded
   - Contact provider

4. Enable auto-reconnect
   - Settings > Encoder
   - Enable automatic reconnection

NO AUDIO IN STREAM
------------------
1. Verify encoder input
   - Settings > Audio > Encoder Input
   - Should capture main output

2. Check audio is playing
   - Something must be playing to stream
   - Test with local playback first

3. Listen to your own stream
   - Open stream URL in media player
   - Verify it's your station

METADATA NOT UPDATING
---------------------
1. Check metadata is enabled
   - Encoder profile settings
   - Enable "Send Now Playing"

2. Server must support metadata
   - Icecast and Shoutcast support it
   - Check server configuration

3. Player may cache metadata
   - Try different player
   - Wait for cache to expire

4. Check user limits
   - User may have hit request limit
   - Check cooldown period

================================================================================
WEB INTEGRATION ISSUES
================================================================================

WORDPRESS PLUGIN NOT CONNECTING
-------------------------------
1. Verify Direct Server is running
   - Settings > Web Server
   - Enable and check port

================================================================================
PERFORMANCE ISSUES
================================================================================

APPLICATION RUNNING SLOW
------------------------
1. Check CPU usage
   - Task Manager > Details
   - High CPU = performance issue

2. Large library impact
   - Very large libraries use more memory
   - Consider splitting into folders

3. Disable unused features
   - Turn off Twitch if not using
   - Disable overlay if not needed
