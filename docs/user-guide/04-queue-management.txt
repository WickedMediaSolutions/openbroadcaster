FOR AUTOMATED OPERATION:
- Enable AutoDJ to automatically fill the queue
- Set a target queue depth (e.g., always keep 5 tracks queued)
- AutoDJ respects your rotation rules

FOR REQUEST SHOWS:
- Keep base music in rotation via AutoDJ
- Requests automatically insert into the queue
- Set request priority (play next vs. add to end)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TIPS AND BEST PRACTICES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. NEVER LET THE QUEUE EMPTY
   - Always keep at least 2-3 tracks queued
   - Enable AutoDJ as a safety net

2. BALANCE REQUESTS AND ROTATION
   - Don't let requests dominate the queue
   - Set limits on pending requests
   - Intersperse requests with rotation music

3. USE HISTORY FOR VARIETY
   - Check history before adding tracks
   - Avoid playing the same song too soon

4. ORGANIZE BY SHOW SEGMENTS
   - Save queue templates for recurring shows
   - Pre-build queues for specific hours
